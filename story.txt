Hengxuan - Xteam 51
Once upon a time, there was a boy
He was living in an old forest

He had just finished his dinner when he heard a knock on the door.
However, when he went to open it, there was no one there.

Suddenly, he heard footsteps coming from behind, inside of his wooden cabin. 
Shocked and afraid, he turned around.

And there it was, the one and only bigfoot eating his freshly made dinner.
